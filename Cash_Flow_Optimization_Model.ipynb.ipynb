    "- **Business Problem:** The company faces a mandatory schedule of lawsuit payments totaling **$330,000+** over the next 15 years.\n",
    "- **Objective:** Minimize the *initial* cash required today to fully fund these future liabilities.\n",
    "- **Methodology:** We modeled a \"Cash Flow Matching\" strategy using Linear Programming (Gurobi). The model dynamically allocates capital between:\n",
    "* **High-yield instruments:** Two specific bonds with different maturities and coupon rates.\n",
    "* **Liquidity instruments:** A savings account (4% yield) to bridge gaps between bond coupon dates and payment deadlines.\n",
